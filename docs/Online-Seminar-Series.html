    <h1>Modelling approaches for disease processes</h1>
<h2>In a Brief</h2>
<p>The Online Seminar Series <strong>“Modelling approaches for disease processes”</strong> is organized by Researchers in Computational Biology and Human Health.<br></p>
<p>In recent decades, computational modeling has been successfully used to describe and better understand fundamental biological processes. 
The field has since evolved significantly and is increasingly addressing biomedical questions in the context of systems biology. 
Diseases are often characterized by a multitude of disturbances in different biological processes that influence each other across various scales.<br></p>
<p>This paradigm shift takes biological complexity into account by using mechanistic modeling approaches to investigate disease processes in an integrative manner. 
This requires close interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge and expertise.<br> </p>
<p>Building on this, the <strong>DiseaseModelling</strong> project group was established with the aim of connecting researchers from different disciplines.
The focus is on key aspects of disease modeling, including the integration of various biological processes, the implementation of disease-related disorders, and the consideration of patient heterogeneity.</p>
<p>A central research topic is the quantitative analysis and integration of high-dimensional data sets into mathematical models. 
These data originate from single-cell sequencing, time-resolved transcriptomics and proteomics, and high-content imaging, among other sources, and provide detailed insights into spatial cell-cell relationships within complex tissues. 
Machine learning methods such as autoencoders, optimal transport, and trained neural networks play a crucial role in this context. 
Of particular importance is their combination with mechanistic modeling approaches in order to obtain interpretable, data-driven descriptions of biological processes.<br></p>
<p>Since January 2022, a monthly <strong>Online Seminar Series</strong> has been held as part of the project group. These seminars focus on introducing, discussing, and comparing different mathematical modeling approaches. 
They also promote exchange between academic research and industrial practice. 
The seminar series is aimed at a broad national and international community and involves members at all career stages, from students and postdoctoral researchers to experienced group leaders.</p>
<p>We would like to thank <strong>Sara Checa</strong> and <strong>Markus Morrison</strong> for their great commitment to the organization team until summer 2024 and 2025, respectively.</p>
<p>For the future, we look forward to the new insights into disease process modelling and to discussing them with you!</p>
<p>If you missed a seminar, you can watch the video recordings of several the talks and discussions. Check out <a href="Previous-Seminars.html">Previous Seminars</a>! Talks with the recording are labeled accordingly.</p>
